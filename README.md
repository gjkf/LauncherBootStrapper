###Basic Informations

This is a BootStrapper that (if configured correctly) will create a folder in different places, based on the OS, that folder will contain the file that's downloaded.

Windows: %APPDATA%
Mac/Linux: userDir/Application Support/

Anyone can configure it, just follow the next steps.

###For setters:

If you unzip the .jar, you'll find the "configurationFile" folder, inside it you'll find a file called "configFile.txt", edit it to customize the bootStrapper. Remember to recompile the .jar after doing that.

###Known issues:

None
