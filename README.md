Just execute the bootStrapper.jar, DO NOT MOVE IT OUT OF THE FOLDER WHERE swt.jar IS! YOU WOULD BREAK IT!

###For Windows Users

By default it will create a folder in the same directory where the .jar is executed.

In order to access the advanced menu, you need to launch the jar with the extra argument "-e", like this (done in the jar directory):

java -jar bootStrapper.jar -e

###For Mac Users

By default it will create a folder in the same directory where the .jar is executed.

In order to access the advanced menu, you need to launch the jar with the extra argument "-e", like this (done in the jar directory):

java -XstartOnFirstThread -jar bootStrapper.jar -e

"-XstartOnFirstThread" is required in order for SWT to work.

###Known issues:
